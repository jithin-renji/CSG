CSG execution

idea:	show structures for all the 11th grade shit (AB2L, AB3L, etc..)
	bond order, bond length, central atom, bond nature, geometry

database usage: store the examples of all the 11th grade shit( minimum 2
	for each type) with info on nature of bond, etc.. it time permits

we need to indicate hybridization details 
 

1.I/O
	user input the chemical formula 

take inp of only di-element compunds
we gonna have predefined coordinated for the different types
take the input compound
check for invalidity and oxidn state of each ele, and check which type it 
belongs to.
if all that goes good:
	provide all the outputs

1. validation of input
2. match it with the coordinate database & deal with mogli

keep checkpoints and keep everyone posted
