CSG execution

1. Idea:

	- Show structures for all the 11th grade shit (AB2L, AB3L, etc..)
	  bond order, bond length, central atom, bond nature, geometry

2. Database usage:
	- Store the examples of all the 11th grade shit( minimum 2
	  for each type) with info on nature of bond, etc.. if time permits

	- We need to indicate hybridization details

3. I/O
	- User input the chemical formula

	- Take input of only di-element compounds

	- We gonna have predefined coordinated for the different types

	- Take the input compound

	- Check for invalidity and oxidn state of each element, and check
	  which type it belongs to.

	- Provide all the outputs

4. Division of processes:
	- Validation of input
	- Match it with the coordinate database & deal with mogli

**Keep checkpoints and keep everyone posted**

=== EXCEPTIONS IN LP ===

H2SO4 -> EXPANDED OCTET
SOCl2 -> EXPANDED OCTET
INCOMPLETE OCTETS!!! -> ClF5, BrF5, ClF3, BrF3, BrCl3

=== ACCEPT THESE TOO ===
- Validation of molecules containing only 1 element.
