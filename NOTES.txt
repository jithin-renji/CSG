CSG execution

1. Idea:

	- Show structures for all the 11th grade shit (AB2L, AB3L, etc..)
	  bond order, bond length, central atom, bond nature, geometry

2. Database usage:
	- Store the examples of all the 11th grade shit( minimum 2
	  for each type) with info on nature of bond, etc.. if time permits

	- We need to indicate hybridization details

3. I/O
	- User input the chemical formula

	- Take input of only di-element compounds

	- We gonna have predefined coordinated for the different types

	- Take the input compound

	- Check for invalidity and oxidn state of each element, and check
	  which type it belongs to.

	- Provide all the outputs

4. Division of processes:
	- Validation of input
	- Match it with the coordinate database & deal with mogli

**Keep checkpoints and keep everyone posted**


updates:

were working on hybridization output

1. find out lone pairs
2. 


lone_pairs = find_lone_pair(ele_dict) # will output the no. of lp (int)
if lone_pair == 1:
...
elif
..



AB 

AB2 	AB2L	AB2L2
AB3	AB3L	AB3L2
AB4	AB4L	AB4L2
AB5	AB5L

AB6
